		<description>Fantastic post! 
I don&#039;t think I can work out to Casey Ho&#039;s videos but everything else here is a great roadmap.

Thanks for taking the time to share ;)</description>

		<description>I&#039;m proud that you&#039;re very determined in achieving your goal through this journey.  Way to go, my girl!  Don&#039;t forget a heathy and balanced lunch box everyday also plays an important role here.  Oops, did you say &quot; Thank you, mom&quot;?  :p</description>

		<description>I couldn&#039;t be prouder of you! As someone who&#039;s been trailing along side you through this journey, I have to say I&#039;ve been witness to the things you&#039;re preaching. I&#039;ve even benefitted simply by virtue of being the person on the other side of the dinner table or your company during your weekend workouts. 

You continue to inspire me to find and make the small adjustments that go the furthest, even if I haven&#039;t followed through with quite the same success rate. I love that you&#039;ve shared your story here - I think it&#039;ll inspire many more. :)</description>

		<description>Thank you, my love! I wish I can see your progress documented. Better yet, I wish I can see YOU, PERIOD! I love that you&#039;re cooking delicious healthy meals for yourself and I&#039;m totally jelly that I can&#039;t be there to devour it with you. I think you have an excuse to give a little leash on the work out schedule and eating habits when you&#039;re busy travelling the world. ;) I would definitely make an exception for that! LURVES YOU LOTS!</description>

		<description>Yesss! I&#039;ve been switching it up, NTC usually updates that feature new workouts from different trainers for different exercises. It&#039;s pretty awesome. Have you seen the Nike+ shoes?! When summer time comes around I&#039;m going to get back into swimming! :) Because if you haven&#039;t noticed, I&#039;m super bad at team sports. LOL</description>

		<description>Your journey is wonderful and your post is beautifully written.  I am more motivated and inspired to continue with my workout routine and my change in eating habits.  It&#039;s been so tough with all the good food while travelling, but like you, I&#039;ve already cut down my rice portion by half and also switched to brown rice only - the good kind of carbs.  I&#039;m still waiting for the day when my exercise regime won&#039;t feel like a routine anymore but I will keep at it until it just feels like a part of my everyday life instead.  Thanks for sharing.  You&#039;re so wondies. LURVES.</description>

		<description>Oh, and you&#039;re probably way past this, but if you ever plateau on your progress and feel like you&#039;re burning out, don&#039;t be afraid to switch exercises.

Variety is good for the muscles and it keeps everything fresh! You can always come back to your tried and true methods right after.</description>

		<description>Good for you Charlotte! It&#039;s hard to start, but getting fit and eating well is probably one of the best and most rewarding things you can do for yourself.

Keep it going. :)</description>
