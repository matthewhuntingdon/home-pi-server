			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How is it that I&#8217;m four months late in discovering <a href="http://www.therocketsummer.com/">The Rocket Summer</a>&#8216;s <em>Of Men and Angels</em> Album?! </p>
<p><center><img src="http://dayofthelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/TheRocketSummerOfMenAndAngels2010_thumb.jpg" alt="Of Men and Angels Album cover" /></center></p>
<p>This is awesome. This album retains the catchy driving rhythms and melodies from his previous album, <em>Do You Feel?</em> (which I LOVED!). I haven&#8217;t even finished listening to the entire album yet, but so far my faves are &#8220;Hills and Valleys&#8221;, &#8220;Walls&#8221; and &#8220;Let you go&#8221;, which features an majestic piano melody that is to DIE for! I wish I could find the sheet music for his songs. I still find it unbelievable that he composes and plays all the instruments himself. Watch this video of Bryce in the studio doing his thang, and prepared to be amazed. </p>

<p>Well done, Bryce, another excellent album just in time for fun filled summer days. </p>

<p>Watch this commercial and you will be in awe. I think the enlightening music does a lot of the work ; ). Even still, I have to give props to the amazing cinematography and the dogs for their desire for treats : ) It&#8217;s amazing how 1:15 minutes of slow motion can truly submerge its audience in the simplest of details and the emotion that it evokes. The video captures raw desire, beauty, and priceless expressions that we love about dogs.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve recently traveled to downtown Toronto by public transit, you&#8217;ve probably seen this cleverly placed ad:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/4352399654_b35b044a5d1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83" title="4352399654_b35b044a5d" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/4352399654_b35b044a5d1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="313" /></a><br />
<strong>source</strong>: <a href="http://torontoseeker.com/item-7231872.htm">http://torontoseeker.com/item-7231872.htm</a></p>
<p>My favourite part about this ad is that Disney has molded this campaign around the a given environment blurring the lines between blatant marketing and immersive art installations. I think this type of advertising certainly makes the commuters trip a little more exciting (at least for me!) and makes the good impact. I enjoyed the fact that they also played with the direction of the trains to define the Red Queen and the White Queen. Trains going northbound being White Queens territory and southbound being the Red Queen&#8217;s, commuters are recruited into the respective Queens&#8217; army. Fun!</p>
<p>Having been giving the opportunity to work downtown, I&#8217;ve been really looking at advertisements critically, particularly in the way they are presented as well the art direction. In addition to travelling downtown, my work has also allowed me to sit in on several brainstorming sessions and meetings where I&#8217;ve learned a lot of about various marketing styles and tactics. One that stood out to me was storyline marketing. I don&#8217;t know the official term for this, but let me explain: This is when a static ad is put up at public transit systems for a period of time, long enough for every-day commuters to remember the message. The ad is then followed up by another ad that relates to the first. Cleverly related. The most recent one I&#8217;ve seen is the series &#8220;Unlimited&#8221; ads I&#8217;ve been noticing on bus shelters and subway platforms. So far, the ad has been presented as the word &#8220;Unlimited&#8221; overlaying nonchalant photos of every day people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/public-unlimitedimage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-93  aligncenter" title="public-unlimitedimage" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/public-unlimitedimage.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to see how this marketing campaign will unfold and reveals their brand!</p>
