			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is truly an art. But once you figure it out, it&#8217;s the best drug you can be addicted to.</p>
<p>Ever since I started working downtown in 2010, I&#8217;ve been basking in the joys of good food and good company. So much so that I had gained my &#8220;Freshman 15&#8243; that I hadn&#8217;t in University.</p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/267792_10150719179965118_665745117_19541317_4777434_n.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-723" title="267792_10150719179965118_665745117_19541317_4777434_n" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/267792_10150719179965118_665745117_19541317_4777434_n-e1330964920145.jpeg" alt="" width="489" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>That picture above is not an exaggeration! It was a steady increase in weight but by the end of 2010, I didn&#8217;t recognize myself. This post isn&#8217;t really about a miraculous weight loss (I worked damn hard) or how I was &#8220;so fat&#8221; because I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I was unhealthy.</p>
<p>My 2010 meals consisted of the following: Bibimbap, sushi platters, beef brisket carrot stew pho, Taiwanese sausage fried rice, pork bone soup, sweet potato fries and incredible amounts of bubble tea. But I think the deadliest culprit were baked goods. Cookies. Cooooookies, *shakes fist* my Kryptonite.</p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/food.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-668" title="food" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/food.png" alt="" width="490" height="938" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="cookies" src="http://www.seattlesfavoritecookies.com/images/bannerpic.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="224" /></p>
<p>Week after week of consuming this made me tired, lazy and obviously wanting more. I had taken for granted my asian metabolism and forgot that I&#8217;m not getting any younger. In January of 2011, the year of my brother&#8217;s wedding, I vowed to lose the Freshman 15 and get back into a fitness routine that can keep off the chubs. I started looking up YouTube videos of Pilates and Tae Bo. Had to start somewhere right?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Billy Blanks" src="http://api.ning.com/files/F5gQpKXmf2bwQxx3fPRXi0-w6YiMG1dAY82aSNgkufdGRvg90riRuRLJoJTQbIznWXO4qWz8wVTxkM99rDRcgZ5bTyljC99J/BillyPromo2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="735" /></p>
<p>No joke, Billy Blanks was my boy for the first 2 months of 2011. I did about 30 minutes of his YouTube videos almost every day. As terrifying as he was, I forced myself to get off the chair and move. I was watching videos anyway! So, why not! I also switched between videos and running on the treadmill (30 minutes). Immediately, I started seeing my weight slowly drop, however, it was still hovering at the same weight for the entire month.</p>
<p>I eventually came to the sad realization that I had to cut down on eating out and cookies if I wanted to see more progress. I cut down my rice portions by half (this was so hard!) and filled up on vegetables and protein instead. This change itself was huge. I was happy with the results and healthier eating choices. However, I didn&#8217;t completely enjoy doing these Tae Bo routines day after day. It got boring as routine activities naturally do.</p>
<p>I was now on the search to do more exercises that I actually enjoyed. This was when I discovered Cassey Ho, from <a title="Pop pilates" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/blogilates?feature=chclk">Pop Pilates</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Cassey Ho" src="http://ameliaflorencesimmons.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/tumblr_lqdlwhaq1y1qca9py.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="700" /></p>
<p>Let me tell you, she has changed my life and my view on exercise and health. Cassey Ho, if you&#8217;re reading this, you are my hero! Never in my life had I come across someone so genuinely enthusiastic about life and exercise that their charisma and motivation was so contagious. And that was it, I had caught the fitness bug. Just like that. She had rekindled my love for Pilates. She marries her love for pop music and pilates beautifully, which is double motivation for me. Her <a title="Blogilates" href="http://blogilates.com/tag/cassey-ho">blog</a> documents her everyday choices and hilarious stories that will make you laugh and cry with her. I&#8217;m sure the entire Blogilates community can vouch for me when I say that she has made me stronger physically and as a person! I can not thank you enough, Cassey!</p>
<p>By the time summer hit, my boyfriend had introduced me to a new fitness app from Nike that was available for the iPhone called <a title="NTC" href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/nike-training-club/id301521403?mt=8">Nike Training Club</a>. I thought I&#8217;d give it a try. Couldn&#8217;t hurt right? Turns out this was the best and most used app I&#8217;d ever have on my iPhone. NTC offers cardio drills that will KILL YOU (in a good way!).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="NTC" src="http://adorninc.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/nike-training-club-app.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="245" /></p>
<p>I worked my way up to the Advanced level and have been coupling these NTC workouts with Pop Pilates and running. This was my magic trio. No joke, every time I finish my 1 hour of exercising I feel at peace and completely satisfied. Hello endorphins! I tweeted Nike Women and was so surprised and glad that they were super supportive!</p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NTC1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-696" title="NTC1" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NTC1.png" alt="" width="490" height="487" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NTC2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-697" title="NTC2" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NTC2.png" alt="" width="490" height="287" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NTC3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-698" title="NTC3" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NTC3.png" alt="" width="490" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>So for those of you who are wondering how to lose your Freshman 15 or just get strong and healthy, here&#8217;s my unprofessional tried and true advice:</p>
<p>• <strong>Hydrate.</strong> Drink lots of water! It&#8217;s like a shower for your insides.</p>
<p>• <strong>Cut down on carbs.</strong> I know it sounds cliché but it works. The more veggies and fruit the better.</p>
<p>• <strong>Find <em>your</em> exercise.</strong> Find the connection between your exercise and you. If you don&#8217;t like running, dance. If you want to try cardio drills, drop and give me 20, soldier!</p>
<p>• <strong>Music.</strong> I think for me, music was a huge thing. I love getting lost in music and I found that when I run for 30 minutes straight on a treadmill, the running becomes less of the focus and my mind and music takes center stage. It&#8217;s actually where I do a lot of my thinking. And before I know it, 30 minutes is over. So go ahead, take that half hour to reflect and get to know yourself!</p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/KBwedding.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-714" title="KBwedding" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/KBwedding.png" alt="" width="490" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a year since my journey and I&#8217;m still going! It&#8217;s no longer a diet, it&#8217;s no longer a routine. It&#8217;s a <em>lifestyle</em> that I can&#8217;t see myself without.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: My skin has never been better ever since I&#8217;ve eaten cleaner and had regular exercise. For those of you suffering through acne, give it a try. Of course a regular sleeping schedule will make an enormous difference. I know it&#8217;s really tough, especially for night owls. I get nagged by my parents still. I hate to say it but&#8230;they&#8217;re right. Trust me, I&#8217;ve tried all the topical creams, needles, facial scrubs you could imagine. The best way is to heal yourself from the inside out. Eat clean, exercise, sleep and you&#8217;ll have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I say DO IT.</p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/380787_10100797738916892_28129798_64819048_260653463_n.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter" title="380787_10100797738916892_28129798_64819048_260653463_n" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/380787_10100797738916892_28129798_64819048_260653463_n-e1330963764934.jpeg" alt="" width="489" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>I still enjoy my faves foods, but always <strong>in moderation</strong>. Good luck to those of you who decide to start your own journey!  It&#8217;s 10% exercise, 10% eating healthy, 80% knowing you can. Once you&#8217;ve wrapped your head around it and change your mindset, you&#8217;ll find it easier to roll out that yoga mat or strap on your running shoes. And remember:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/No-Matter-How-Slow-You-Go-You-Are-Still-Lapping-Everybody-On-The-Couch.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770" title="No Matter How Slow You Go - You Are Still Lapping Everybody On The Couch" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/No-Matter-How-Slow-You-Go-You-Are-Still-Lapping-Everybody-On-The-Couch.jpeg" alt="" width="490" height="654" /></a></p>
<p> To good health and happiness!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bracelets in your faces! That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s another bracelet attack.</p>
<p>I was inspired this weekend by friends, family and of course, Pinterest to create some new bracelets. I&#8217;ve been craving some down time to myself and I thought hitting up Michael&#8217;s and making some bracelets were the way to go! I made some new <a href="http://www.hiphipgingin.com/2010/08/25/chan-luu/" target="_blank">Chan Luu</a> inspired wrap bracelets as well as a milk/black/gold beaded bracelet just for kicks. I followed <a href="http://sewpetitegal.blogspot.com/2010/11/leather-wrap-bracelet-video-tutorial.html">this tutorial</a> on how to make wrap bracelets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-635" title="photo 2" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="368" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-634" title="photo 1" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="368" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-653" title="photo 3" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-31-e1330927059471.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Wrap Bracelet Materials:</strong></p>
<p>• Leather cord<br />
• Monofilament<br />
• Small gold beads<br />
• Large closure bead</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made this seahorse bracelet a couple weeks back but haven&#8217;t had the chance to post it. My friend Juice and I made these BFF bracelets before she flew off to Vancity (I miss you lots!).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-638" title="Sea Horse Bracelet" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/391082_10100851000155942_28129798_65202559_40774977_n.jpeg" alt="" width="490" height="653" /></p>
<p><strong>Seahorse Bracelet (simply braided):</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>• Embroidery thread (Dark Navy, Blue Grey, Rust, Fiery Red)<br />
• Gold chain<br />
• Sea horse charm<br />
• Toggle closure</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also wanted to give a warm thank you to my favourite girls from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/helloberry">Helloberry</a> for making me this (super) special edition turquoise bracelet pictured here in my Saturday bracelet stack :) I love it! They&#8217;ve got loads of colourful bracelets perfect for spring/summer. I can&#8217;t wait to don them out in the open without my winter jacket in the way!</p>

<p>Good bye weekend, back to reality. And back into my work out routine (More on that to come!)</p>
<p>Adios mi amigos!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m alive!</p>
<p>Not that I&#8217;ve ever left, but I&#8217;ve been quite a busy body with the new year and brand new projects at work that has transformed me into a hermit. I&#8217;ve also been quite occupied with some exciting freelance work that I will one day share with you all!</p>
<p>Luckily, Family day long weekend was my saviour and has given me a breather. So now I&#8217;m able to catch up on some things like blogging and crafting : ) This past long weekend I&#8217;ve been obsessing over <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/48082350/modern-friendship-orchid">modern friendship bracelets</a>, much like the ones seen on <a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>. Ever since I was a little girl I&#8217;ve loved crafting up a storm and especially when it came to jewelry. I still have my crazy box of bracelet threads and beads to prove it!</p>
<div id="attachment_476" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-21-at-7.20.25-PM-e1298335367356.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-476" title="Screen shot 2011-02-21 at 7.20.25 PM" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-21-at-7.20.25-PM-e1298335367356.png" alt="" width="500" height="328" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My box of childhood craziness.</p></div>
<p>&#8230;and no, I wasn&#8217;t very organized. I think I braided more than 50 friendship bracelets to be honest. I&#8217;ve also tried my hand at earrings once. I made my teacher a pair of paper crane earrings : ) Anyway, back to my obsession. So, I had been cleaning up around my room and I realized I had a whole pile of broken necklaces that I have no intention to wear again. A lot of which were just the chains. Gold, silver, thick, thin. You name it, I had it. As I was cleaning up I was also reading a fashion blog called <a href="http://www.iamstyle-ish.com/">I am Stylish</a>. I was amazed at her unique vintage jewelry as well as bracelets she had bought from the same designer on Etsy. I was inspired to make some of my own. After all, what was I supposed to do with all these miscellaneous chains and charms?</p>
<p>All these years of accumulated charms that I&#8217;ve never worn and chains that I thought were too nice to throw away, little did I know I had all the ingredients in front of me to make a unique set of modern friendship bracelets! Here are a few photos of some that I&#8217;ve made over the last 72 hours!</p>
<p>No joke, I went bracelet crazy.</p>

<p>I still have some left over necklaces but I&#8217;m out of charms and connecting pieces like the lobster clasp. This would be an amazing gift idea for a friend. If it&#8217;s too cold out where you are, try staying in with your girlfriend(s) or boyfriend(s)? and make some cute bracelets for each other! I know I will.</p>
<p>Also, I made my own DIY headband from an old scrunchy (remember those things from way back when!?). I proudly donned it on my head last Friday. Tried to take a quick picture before getting caught! haha</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe I should make it a rule to post once every two months because that&#8217;s pretty much what I&#8217;ve been doing! I have several exciting bits of news to share with you all.</p>
<p><strong>NUMERO 1:</strong><br />
Yesterday was Sunday the 31st of Octobe a.k.a Halloween. However, my friends and I decided to celebrate halloween the Friday before and man did we have a BLAST. This year the big bash was at my house and boy did the halloween theme make a difference. This year the girls and I decided to go head-to-head with the boys in a halloween contest! It was super fun brainstorming ideas. Box of Crayons, Evil female villains in Disney movies and even Spice Girls. In the end, we came up with an ingenious idea. We&#8217;d dress up as <strong>the boys</strong> themselves. I believe this was the most fun halloween I&#8217;ve had in years. We made this a sort of runway show with music accompaniment that reflects the personalities of each person. As well we finished off each person with a tag line! This is a great idea for anyone who wants to have a hoot and a half at a halloween party between friends! Guaranteed many inside jokes to be had by all.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo-1-e1288637829456.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-414" title="photo-1" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo-1-e1288637829456.jpeg" alt="" width="500" /></a></center>On top of that genius costume idea (girl&#8217;s won, btw), we had a pumpkin carving contest! Two pumpkins for the girls and two for the guys. I think it&#8217;s safe to say the GIRLS took this one home. But I have to give the guys some props for their &#8220;themed but unoriginal designs&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>NUMERO 2:</strong><br />
Bought a new camera (Panasonic LX5) for myself in preparation for surprise NUMERO 3. The LX5 apparently does very well in low-light. I&#8217;ve only taken a few shots with it so far and I still need to buy a case for it, but I&#8217;m super excited to give this a whirl in a place that isn&#8217;t my messy room!</p>
<p><center><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo-21-e1288638817139.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-443" title="photo (2)" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/photo-21-e1288638817139.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="301" /></a></center>My wallet definitely feels a lot lighter but it is well worth it! I still have to play around and learn all the functions but thanks to my photographer friend (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/djjacreative">@djjacreative</a>) I will be a pro in time for&#8230;</p>

PARIS. AHH I&#8217;M GOING TO PARIS! This is the reason why I splurged on buying a camera&#8230;In two weeks, I will be taking glorious photos of Paris landscapes! I&#8217;m going to be there for a weeks time and drop by London for a day as well. Everyone who is looking to go on trips on a budget check out <a href="http://www.travelzoo.ca">Travel Zoo</a> and sign up for their weekly Top 20 Deals!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, its been a while hasn&#8217;t it?! I&#8217;ve been busy making the most of my summer because as you know with the blink of an eye there&#8217;s only a couple weeks of summer left. Every time I hear that phrase I cringe a little&#8230;Moving on!</p>
<p>For the past couple of weeks, the weather has been AMAZING, fluctuating between 25-30 degrees celsius with humidity. I&#8217;m not complaining : ) As a testament to this beautiful weather, I&#8217;ve actually gotten myself into a colourfully fun personal project that I deemed <strong>Geek Rainbow</strong>. This is how it all started.</p>
<p>As some of you know, I work as an interactive designer at Espresso. One sunny afternoon, the art director, Jigisha and I took a walk out to buy some art supplies she needed. She bought three canvases hoping to paint self portraits for a contest. Myself, having never taken a painting lesson or formal art training was quite overwhelmed by the amount of supplies that were in the store! I told her that I&#8217;ve never painted on a canvas in my life. She grabbed an extra canvas and convinced me to give it a try. I hesitantly agreed to it because I knew it would be fun but wasn&#8217;t sure where to start. I had no art supplies that weren&#8217;t for kids! I was also concerned about her paying for it. But I was excited to have a blank canvas, something to signify a new start&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-2.41.09-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380" title="Screen shot 2010-08-09 at 2.41.09 PM" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-2.41.09-PM.png" alt="" width="510" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>For more than several weeks the canvas laid there on my dresser collecting dust. But I knew that I wanted to paint on it eventually. I&#8217;m going to back track a couple weeks before this to give some context to this story. Lately, I had been stuck in a mundane routine of going to work and home with nothing really to look forward to but another weekend of &#8220;No plans, really&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t entirely happy or entirely sad. I was feeling <strong>mediocre</strong>. Uninspired. I knew I wanted to change that. I wanted to do something with my time. With myself. This new state of mind came into play July 1st. I made a list of what I needed to do:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Stop limiting myself</strong>: Remove mental barriers that have been impeding on my abilities and drive to do things.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve been putting off buying paint supplies because I keep making up excuses or assumptions for myself. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have the car, because my mom will be using it over the weekend.&#8221; When I could&#8217;ve simply asked to borrow the car for an hour to go buy it!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/39938_938880324422_28129798_56659001_4388665_n-e1281366639771.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-273" title="39938_938880324422_28129798_56659001_4388665_n" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/39938_938880324422_28129798_56659001_4388665_n-e1281366639771.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="312" /></a></p>
<p>2. <strong>Re-evaluate what to spend money on</strong>: A lot of times money is my reason for putting something off. I feel that my (asian) upbringing had made me so conscious of saving money that I had been using it as an excuse.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though I am currently working, I had still been preventing myself in doing the things I dream to do just because it would cost a slice of my pay check. Then I realized that I eventually just end up spending that money on clothing or shoes! (Clearly, my girly side taking over) So, I decided to myself, &#8220;You know what? It doesn&#8217;t matter how much the paint/brushes/canvases cost (although I did buy a smaller paint pack for a good deal!), I needed this in order to follow through with my plan.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>3. <strong><del datetime="2010-08-09T17:38:00+00:00">Put myself first</del> Love myself</strong>: I have always had a tendency to put others first, but I realized the ultimate disadvantage of this when I started to feel unhappy with myself. Unconditional love from anyone is amazing for support and I love being the provider of that to family and friends. However, I&#8217;ve been neglecting to support myself and my own needs in order to grow as a person. I started thinking, had I given myself that much unconditional love and time I could have benefited from it much earlier. I now understand that you are your own caregiver. Your body and soul relies on you to give it what it needs. Whether it is food/exercise or even TLC! : )</p>
<ul>
<li>It made me happy to finally be able to focus on myself and do something I wanted to do. To follow through with my own plans. To give myself what I want. To paint what I wanted to paint. This Geek Rainbow project was something I could proudly call my own.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/39666_941814189932_28129798_56805830_3563293_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-276" title="39666_941814189932_28129798_56805830_3563293_n" src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/39666_941814189932_28129798_56805830_3563293_n.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="604" /></a></p>
<p>Here are three of the rainbow canvases completed so far! Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver. I&#8217;ve also had a fourth done up in red (Flash) but I haven&#8217;t had a chance to take a picture of it in natural light (which looks 100x better, darn iPhone camera and energy saving lightbulbs). For those of you who don&#8217;t know, these are the Adobe CS4 Icons. I wanted to paint these real life icons because I felt that coming from a digital background I wanted to transcend my creativity into this traditional art form.</p>
<p>After buying all the materials and supplies, starting the project was SO easy and fun! I could barely wait! Squirting globs of yellow paint onto the surface of a 12&#215;12&#8243; 100% cotton stretched canvas felt good. <em>Real good</em>. I helped me escape into a world of colours, mixing shades, and detailed perfection. It also made me realize how easy Adobe has made art out to be! How easy it is just to create swatches with an eyedropper rather than mixing your own colours a million times. How easy it is to choose your brush and brush size with a click of the trackpad. Cleaning up on photoshop/illustrator is as simple as cmd+Q. Keeping your files neatly stored away in a 15&#8243; laptop. But there is an indescribable joy about using your hands, feeling the tools, the smell of fresh paint and genuinely experiencing the essence of art.</p>

<p>So, after weeks of putting it off, I&#8217;ve finally done it. I&#8217;m very happy with myself and this project because it has helped me learn more about my abilities not only as a designer, but as an artist. It has opened up my mind to a whole new world of creativity and a whole new way of thinking. This project has gone above and beyond my own expectations. From never having painted on a canvas to painting four within a week I think is quite commendable, wouldn&#8217;t you agree? : )</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about everything you hate about rainy days? Getting up at 6am and it&#8217;s gloomy as hell. Body aches from the low pressure. Or even just getting your pants/socks/hair wet. You just <em>know</em> that it&#8217;s going to be a really shitty day. Lately, the weather has been teasing Torontonians to the max! A few nice sunny days with a high of 20+ degrees celsius&#8230; and then BOOM. A blast of thunder showers for 3 days! Ta Daaa!</p>
<p><center><img src="http://charlottetang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rain-e1270868025704.jpg"></center></p>
<p>Yesterday, like every other day, I was on my way home from work: Exhausted on the streetcar, sleeping on the subway, becoming deaf on the RT, and getting crushed on the bus (I really make use of the TTC system, ha!). I finally get picked up and as I&#8217;m in the car staring out the window, I thought to myself&#8230; &#8220;damn, the grass is green&#8221;. And you know what? Without that rain, that grass wouldn&#8217;t have been so green. And those sunny days wouldn&#8217;t have look so beautiful without that green ass grass! That thought made me smile, and then I proceeded to sing that &#8220;Raindrops keep falling on my head&#8221; song. That is the story of how I made my own day better : )</p>
<p>The End.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m (virtually) aliiiiiiiive! Well, let me first say that this blog has been long overdue. Blogging is going to be a new venture for me, becoming acquainted with myself and all of you out there as a speck in the virtual world with a personality! Although, I can&#8217;t say that this isn&#8217;t the first time working on a website. </p>
<p>My name is Charlotte, I&#8217;m a designer. More specifically, I&#8217;d like to consider myself a web/graphic designer. I&#8217;ve been educated and trained to design user-friendly websites at the UofT New Media program. I currently work at Imaginahome Inc. as a graphic designer, but hope to break into the web industry soon!</p>
<p>More posts to come about design, music, videos, and people &#038; technology!  *excited*</p>
<p>Charlotte</p>
